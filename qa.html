      <td>What are the difference between tourists and visit relative or friend visa?</td>
      <td>The primary differences between a tourist visa and a visiting relatives or friends visa for Japan, as outlined by Attic Tours, are as follows:\n\n1. **Purpose of Visit:**\n   - **Tourist Visa:** The purpose is to visit Japan for tourism, sightseeing, or leisure activities.\n   - **Visiting Relatives or Friends Visa:** The purpose is to visit friends or relatives who reside in Japan.\n\n2. **Requirements:**\n   - **Tourist Visa:** Generally requires a passport, application form, facial photo, birth certificate, marriage certificate (if applicable), and an itinerary in Japan.\n   - **Visiting Relatives or Friends Visa:** Requires similar documents but also includes an invitation letter from the friend or relative in Japan, proof of relationship, residence certificate of the inviter, and possibly additional financial documents if the inviter is covering expenses.\n\n3. **Proof of Relationship:**\n   - **Tourist Visa:** No proof of relationship is necessary since the visit is for tourism.\n   - **Visiting Relatives or Friends Visa:** Requires documentation to prove the relationship with the inviter, such as birth or marriage certificates, photos, or correspondence.\n\n4. **Financial Requirements:**\n   - **Tourist Visa:** May require bank certificates and tax payment certificates to demonstrate the applicant’s ability to support themselves during their stay.\n   - **Visiting Relatives or Friends Visa:** May require similar financial documents for both the applicant and the inviter if the inviter is covering expenses.\n\n5. **Application Process:**\n   - **Tourist Visa:** The application process is more straightforward and typically does not require as many supporting documents related to relationships.\n   - **Visiting Relatives or Friends Visa:** The process is more detailed due to the need for additional documentation to establish relationships and intentions.\n\nFor more detailed information about specific requirements, you can visit the official website of the Japanese Embassy in the Philippines: [Japan Visa Information](https://www.ph.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/00_000035.html).</td>
